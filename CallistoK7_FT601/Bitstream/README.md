Callisto K7 FT601 32-bit USB3.0 FIFO Bridge Loopback Example Project

This folder contains all the required files to program the board and observe the output. Run the "download.bat" file (double click). This will program the board and also run the ft600-245-sync-fifo-loopback.exe file. You can now observe the data being transferred.
(NOTE: You might need to modify the path of "xsct.bat" used in the "download.bat" file to the actual path of "xsct.bat" as in your PC.)
